# Data Analysis and Visualization with JupyterDash

This repository houses an interactive data analysis and visualization application, constructed using JupyterDash. The application is equipped with a variety of tools designed to make data exploration intuitive and insightful. Here are the key features encapsulated within the application:

## Features

- **Data Preview**: Gives a brief snapshot of the dataset, acquainting the user with the data at hand.
  
- **Heatmap**: Presents a correlation heatmap of the different variables, enabling a visual understanding of relationships within the data.

- **Histograms**: Illustrates the frequency distribution of numerical data to facilitate an understanding of the distribution of values.

- **Box Plots**: Offers a visual depiction of the summary statistics of numerical columns.

- **Scatter Plots**: Creates plots that illustrate the relationship between the target variable and numerical features.

- **Feature Importance Plot**: Employs a Random Forest model to showcase which features have the most significant impact on the target variable.

- **Residuals Plot**: Displays the difference between actual and predicted values, providing an insight into the performance of our linear regression model.

- **CRNN Prediction**: Leverages an advanced Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network model to make predictions on the target variable.

This application is flexible and adaptable, capable of working with a wide variety of datasets. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit that consolidates multiple facets of data analysis and visualization in one place.
